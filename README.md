## Incompatibilities:
+ [Russian locale for some mods](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/nucleargen/factorio-ru)
+ [Portal Research Addon](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/nucleargen/portal-research-addon)
+ [Toxic Jungle](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/nucleargen/toxic-jungle)
+ [Mountains](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/nucleargen/Mountains-up)
+ [Noxys Extra Settings Info](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/CobaltSky/Noxys_Extra_Settings_Info)
+ [Big Brother Tweaked](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/nucleargen/Big_Brother_Tweaked)

All of these mods are added to mod dependecies with < 0.0.1 version to prevent startup with it.
If you found other incompatibilities - tell, i'll resolve it or add to list

## Known issues:
Not full localization of Creative mode and Portal Research.
Missings locale string in mod-setting-description when original mod doesn't have descriptions. Affects any not-supported mod.

## Future plans:
+ Add settings for turn on/off updated graphics for other mods
+ Moar customizable features
+ Maybe cross-integrate/localize other mods (possibly by community request)
+ RSO-like resource generator based on remote interfaces and per-surface settings, including AngelsInfiniteOres-like spawning (also fully customizable)
+ Include optional plutonium workarounds like some other mods (mostly like in GotLag's [Reactors](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/GotLag/Reactors), but not the same
+ Rework Air Filtering and include it in pack

## Disclaimer:
All changes in graphics, localizations and behaviours i've made firstly for myself, not for others. You can disagree with it, but it is so. I don't like to use mods that adds too much complexity in game, so you can't find bob's and angel's mods integration soon. But maybe later...
