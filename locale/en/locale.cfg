fcm_factorium_ore_graphics=New Factorium ore graphics
fcm_factorium_ore_omnitraction_tier=Factorium ore omnitraction tier
fcm_strange_matter_only_omnite=Strange matter only to omnite
fcm_only_omnite=Offworld resources: only omnite
fcm_omnite_weight=Omnite generation weight
fcm_offworld_factorium_ore=Offworld Factorium ore

[mod-setting-description]
fcm_factorium_ore_graphics=Changes Factorium ore graphics to looks nicer and be more corresponding to its name. Also, it does no more interfere with omnite graphics if Omnimatter mod present
fcm_factorium_ore_omnitraction_tier=Factorium ore omnitraction tier\n\nWorks only if Omnimatter and Portal Research present together
fcm_strange_matter_only_omnite=With this setting enabled you can only turn strange matter to omnite, not other resources\n\nWorks only if Omnimatter and StrangeMatter present together
fcm_only_omnite=Generate only omnite ore at offworld sites. If unchecked - it possible to find other ores on asteroids.\n\nWorks only if Omnimatter and Portal Research present together
fcm_omnite_weight=If only omnite setting unchecked - defines possibility to find other ores. Smaller value - more often other ores at offworld sites.\n\nWorks only if Omnimatter and Portal Research present together
fcm_offworld_factorium_ore=If only omnite setting unchecked - enables offworld generation of factorium ore
